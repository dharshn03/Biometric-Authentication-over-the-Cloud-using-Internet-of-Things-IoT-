Biometric authentication is a technique that relies on distinct physical or behavioural characteristics to identify individuals. This includes unique traits like facial recognition  or fingerprints. Traditionally, this data was stored on local devices or secure servers, but the rise of cloud computing has led to a shift towards cloud-based biometric authentication systems. Such systems take advantage of cloud technology and adaptable IOT components to provide a secure and efficient access control solution. The system incorporates an ESP32 board and R307 Sensor to collect biometric information from users, and then sends it to the cloud database for storage.The Amazon DynamoDB Cloud Database uses AES -256 Encryption for the data at rest to ensure the security of the biometric data. By using this encryption approach, sensitive biometric information remains protected both during transmission and storage. The cloud database stores the encrypted data and verifies it against the information provided by the user during authentication. Access is granted only when the data matches. This eliminates the need for physical access cards or passwords and creates a streamlined and secure solution. By combining biometric authentication along with features of AWS Cloud, this system offers enhanced security, making it a reliable and trusted option for access control. Overall, this system is ansafe, secure and scalable solution for access control that leverages the power of cloud computing.
